## Demo plugin + Web Dashboard

To use the Endpoints provided by the Demo plugin to enable registration, the Web Dashboard must have in its configuration the API Token of the user generated automatically by this plugin.

Once the Demo Plugin and the Web Dashboard are installed, to configure the Web Dashboard go to src/config.json:

* Add your url of GLPI API located in Setup>General>API tab.
* As USER TOKEN add the Service's API Token located in the Flyve MDM Demo settings.

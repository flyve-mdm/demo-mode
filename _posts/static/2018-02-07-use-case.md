## Registration feature

The Flyve MDM Demo plugin, allows the self creation of accounts, feature not available from GLPI, this means that users who don't have a previous account in GLPI can be able to generate their own accounts from the Web App without requesting these credentials to a registered user.

The new registered user will have access to the Web App and GLPI interface.

## Time trial

Demo plugin comes with a time limit trial of 90 days, if this time limit is not enabled, the user's account created and validated will have access to the features provided either in Flyve MDM or GLPI without duration limit, however if enabled the accounts registered will be disabled after this period of time.
